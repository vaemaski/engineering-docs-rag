Applies Batch Normalization over a 4D input.

4D is a mini-batch of 2D inputs
with additional channel dimension. Method described in the paper Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing
Internal Covariate Shift .

The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension over
the mini-batches and γ \gamma γ and β \beta β are learnable parameter vectors
of size C (where C is the input size). By default, the elements of γ \gamma γ are set
to 1 and the elements of β \beta β are set to 0. At train time in the forward pass, the
standard-deviation is calculated via the biased estimator, equivalent to torch.var(input, correction=0) . However, the value stored in the moving average of the
standard-deviation is calculated via the unbiased estimator, equivalent to torch.var(input, correction=1) .

Also by default, during training this layer keeps running estimates of its
computed mean and variance, which are then used for normalization during
evaluation. The running estimates are kept with a default momentum of 0.1.

If track_running_stats is set to False , this layer then does not
keep running estimates, and batch statistics are instead used during
evaluation time as well.

Note

This momentum argument is different from one used in optimizer
classes and the conventional notion of momentum. Mathematically, the
update rule for running statistics here is x ^ new = ( 1 − momentum ) × x ^ + momentum × x t \hat{x}_\text{new} = (1 - \text{momentum}) \times \hat{x} + \text{momentum} \times x_t x ^ new ​ = ( 1 − momentum ) × x ^ + momentum × x t ​ ,
where x ^ \hat{x} x ^ is the estimated statistic and x t x_t x t ​ is the
new observed value.

Because the Batch Normalization is done over the C dimension, computing statistics
on (N, H, W) slices, it’s common terminology to call this Spatial Batch Normalization.

**Parameters :**

- num_features ( int ) – C C C from an expected input of size ( N , C , H , W ) (N, C, H, W) ( N , C , H , W )
- eps ( float ) – a value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
Default: 1e-5
- momentum ( float | None ) – the value used for the running_mean and running_var
computation. Can be set to None for cumulative moving average
(i.e. simple average). Default: 0.1
- affine ( bool ) – a boolean value that when set to True , this module has
learnable affine parameters. Default: True
- track_running_stats ( bool ) – a boolean value that when set to True , this
module tracks the running mean and variance, and when set to False ,
this module does not track such statistics, and initializes statistics
buffers running_mean and running_var as None .
When these buffers are None , this module always uses batch statistics.
in both training and eval modes. Default: True
- bias ( bool ) – If set to False , the layer will not learn an additive bias (only relevant if affine is True ). Default: True

**Shape:**

- Input: ( N , C , H , W ) (N, C, H, W) ( N , C , H , W )
- Output: ( N , C , H , W ) (N, C, H, W) ( N , C , H , W ) (same shape as input)

Examples:

```python
>>> # With Learnable Parameters
>>> m = nn.BatchNorm2d(100)
>>> # Without Learnable Parameters
>>> m = nn.BatchNorm2d(100, affine=False)
>>> input = torch.randn(20, 100, 35, 45)
>>> output = m(input)
